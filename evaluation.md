## Modelling the distribution of biodiversity and climate change
### [Evaluation]

#### Individual research study

Each student will conduct an individual research study addressing (1) the interactions OR (2) the impacts of global climate changes on marine biodiversity. The students can choose one of the following topics:

[1] Identify the main climatic drivers shaping the distribution of one or more marine species;<br>
[2] Predict present distributional ranges for one or more marine species;<br>
[3] Project future range shifts for one or more marine species;<br>
[4] Predict potential marine invasion processes for one or more marine species;<br>
[0] Additional topics can be proposed (in such case, please contact the professor).
<br><br>
To successfully conduct the individual research study, the students must perform the following tasks:
<br><br>
[1] Gather biodiversity data for one or more marine species;<br>
[2] Gather environmental data to model the distribution of one or more marine species;<br>
[3] Model the distribution of one or more marine species;<br>
[4] Write a report with the following format:
<br><br>
        [4.1] Abstract: What was done in a nutshell (Max. 250 words);<br>
        [4.2] Introduction: Brief statement on what is the problem (Max. 500 words);<br>
        [4.3] Methods: Brief statement on how the problem was solved (Max. 250 words);<br>
        [4.4] Code to perform modelling and the main Figures;<br>
        [4.5] Results: Brief statement on what was found out (Max. 250 words);<br>
        [4.6] Discussion: Brief statement on what it means (Max. 250 words);<br>
        [4.7] References: Whose work was referred.
<br><br>
To successfully write the report, the students must:
<br><br>
[1] Formulate a relevant research ecological question (e.g., in the scope of climate change impacts);<br>
[2] Formulate an hypothesis, based on the general theories presented in the lectures or from the course literature;<br>

#### Major milestones

[16 Dec.] Speed talks (5 minutes) + Brief discussion (5 minutes).<br>
The student will perform a presentation where they show the major findings of their research study addressing the interactions or impacts of global climate changes on marine biodiversity.<br><br>

[09 Jan] Final report (R markdown format).<br>
The students must send the final report to jmassis@ualg.pt.<br><br>
